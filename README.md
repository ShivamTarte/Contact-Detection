# Contact-Detection
This is my second competition in kagle in which players contact is detected based on distance,accleration,x and y disatance and other factors and even through image we have to detect contact.Multiple dataset is given we have to found out contact at each step, each player and ground at multiple game play at frequency of 10 hz as one step.I successfully submitted the code.Based on this multiple features output 1 or 0 can be given as contact detection or not.

This is for national football league of america for detecing contact for harm and injuries.I am established my code on tracking data but i will adding my code more on video data by using YOLO
